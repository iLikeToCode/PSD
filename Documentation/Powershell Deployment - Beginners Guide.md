## Step 1: Download and Install Windows ADK

   - Click **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.

## Step 2: Download and Install WinPE Add-on

## Step 4: Configure MDT

**DO NOT** launch the Deployment Workbench. This will be done when the PSD portion is done; it build your deploymentshare for you.

>NOTE: While MDT can work with Windows 11 with some modifications, it is no longer supported by Microsoft, nor are x86 deployments. However, integrating PSD modifies MDT to continue deployment of Windows 11 images.

To ensure things run smoother:

- Run command as an administrator on the MDT server:

```cmd
Mkdir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\x86\WinPE_OCs"
```
- Download the necessary drivers need to support your models
- Download a Operating System ISO. These can be pull from MSDN or from the official link: [Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11?ISO&msockid=1a583ca89d6d67bd32e8289a9c446670)
- Download Applications needed.
>NOTE: Application setup is not provided with this documentation, however there are several guides online to show how it done.
