- Enter and monitor PSD issues via the [PSD GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/FriendsOfMDT/PSD/issues). You can sort by author, contributor, label (class), and more here.
- Before you creating new issues, search first! Be sure to check out the [Advanced Search](https://github.com/search/advanced) features of GitHub
- Be sure to scan through the MOST POPULAR [most popular](https://github.com/<somelink>) feature requests.
- If you find your issue already exists, contribute relevant comments and add your reaction

    * 👎 -> DownVote

If you cannot find an existing issue similar to your bug or feature, create a **new** issue using the guidelines below.

### Submitting Bug Reports and Feature Requests

- Please only one issue or feature request per submission. 
- Do **not** enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. 
- Many issues look similar, but may have different causes.
- More information is better, provide sufficient details to reproduce or narrow down the problem.
